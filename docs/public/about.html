                    <p id="p1"> 
                        My full name is Aitana Imaz Chuquimarca, and I am 18 years old. Currently, I study a double degree of
                        Mathematics and Computer Engineering in Francisco de Vitoria University. I was born in Madrid, Spain
                        and I have lived here my whole life. Some of my hobbies include playing the guitar, going for a run, and
                        spending time with my loved ones!
                        <br><br>
                        I wanted to study Computer Engineering alongside Mathematics because I have always been interested in the
                        study of software and programming, and how this knowledge helps computer engineers be able to build incredible
                        things, from microprocessors to control systems. <br><br>

                            <b>My hope is to be able to leave this world better than when I came into it, and I think studying Computer Science will allow me
                            the opportunity to accomplish that.</b>
                            <br><br> While I am still a little bit unsure of what I want my occupation to be in the future, 
                            high employability in Spain for jobs with mathematics, statistics and data science is an incentive for me to look more into those 
                            fields in the near future.
