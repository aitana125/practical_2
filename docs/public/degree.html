                <p>
                    I am studying a double degree in Mathematics and Computer Engineering.
                    
                    <br><br>

                    The purpose of this degree is to understand the nature, methods and purposes of the different fields of both mathematics
                    and computer engineering, and recognise the presence of mathematics within almost all subsequents fields the student
                    will encounter during their degree.

                    <br><br>

                    My classes for the first four years of the course are largely dedicated to the mathematics aspect of the double degree, 
                    whilst still being required for 2 mandatory computing classes to be taken in place of the usual optional classes 
                    single math majors have. In my fourth year I will present my TFG for the mathematics side of the degree and in my fiinal
                    and fifth year the classes will be entirely dedicated to the Computer Engineering degree, with its respective TFG needed to 
                    be presented at the end of the academic year.

                    <br><br>

                    To explore the different subjects my program entails, use the DEGREE button from the navegation bar that is now a
                    <b>dropdown menu</b>. You will see the subjects split between the five years of the degree, as well as an extra tab dedicated
                    to the first-year subject <b>Fundamentals of Computer Engineering</b>.

                    <br><br>

                    All the subject information has been taken from the universities public 2024/2025 study plan.
