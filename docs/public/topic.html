                        Ethical problems begin to arise when Generative AI remains unregulated within the video game
                        industry due to the lack of protection of users’ data, the material it uses for training, and what
                        it means for those who are being undermined/replaced by this technology.

                            <u><b>1. USER DATA</b></u> <br><br>
                            Nowadays, everybody is aware that companies collect user data. This information will be processed, packaged and sold for
                            profits to 3rd parties, who are then able to form an online profile of the user. It can include their patterns in purchases,
                            credit card information, name, age, address, search history and phone number. This profile can then be used for malicious
                            intents, such as intrusive pop-up ads and unsolicited emails <b><small>(Usercentrics, 2021)</small></b>. Data brokers were traditionally in charge
                            of acquiring the users’ data until the rise in Generative AI led to the increased demand for data scrapers, which are other
                            AI’s designed specifically to search for the data they have been tasked to collect to provide in the Generative AI training
                            process.
                            
                            <br><br>
                            The targeted age groups for a video game’s user demographic vary between genres, but generally it can be found that they are
                            young. Gen Alpha (0-13 years old currently) are the generation with the highest video game users. 79% of them play weekly while
                            half of the people ages 18 or older do not <b><small>(Takahashi, 2024)</small></b>. That comes to no surprise; parents have become more comfortable
                            with letting their children spend hours unattended on their electronic devices while they go to work.

                            <br><br>
                            Young video game users are thus more likely to be taken advantage of by ill-natured 3rd parties. This is because as Generative AI
                            becomes more integral to the structure of video games, the easier the scraping of user data without their consent will become.

                            A very popular type of Generative AI used in the video game industry is text-to-image models, such as Midjourney. They operate by
                            breaking down the words a user has written as their prompt and matching them with already established imagery associations gained
                            through their training. The AI can then provide a wide range of features in their image generation, from what the image depicts to
                            the style it is in <small>(such as a renaissance painting, pixel art, realism…)</small>.

                            <br><br>
                            The ethical dilemma relies on the fact that the training data these Procedural Content Generators <small>(PCGs)</small> use are copyrighted works.
                            Companies such as Open AI take millions of videos they find on the internet, without permission, and then train their Generative AI
                            model Sora. They profit to a much higher degree than the creators would have ever and do not properly compensate them in return, and
                            this trend has become increasingly common in the video game industry.

                            Many large gaming companies have already made use of Generative AI during the production process, despite their avid denial.
                            Activision, recently acquired by Microsoft, laid off 1900 of their employees, including their entire 2D art department. Following
                            this was the news of Activision’s use of Midjourney and Stable Diffusion to generate cosmetics for their game Call of Duty: Modern
                            Warfare 3, which was then sold at $15 on their in-game store <small>(seen on the right)</small>, as well as Open-AI’s 3.5 GPT model
                            for concept art and asset generation <b><small> (Bureau, 2024) </small></b>. Around 90% of companies in the industry have already
                            incorporated Generative AI programs into their games <b><small>(Petrosyan, 2023)</small></b>.

                            <br><br>
                            While this loss of traditional jobs will lead to the creation of new ones in the future, companies currently do not see AI as a tool
                            to enhance work, but as a replacement of the workers. It is an opportunity to cut down on labor costs, sacrificing quality for “good
                            enough” and blindsighting remaining employees in art, quality testing, and development who now have to work even harder to correct the
                            AI’s mistakes <b><small>(Merchant, 2024)</small></b>.

                            Generative AI may be an incredible tool to make game production much more efficient and cost-effective, but there still remain many
                            ethical issues yet to be addressed.
