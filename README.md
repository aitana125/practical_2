# practical_2

# Specifics:

- Globally:
- The header was the first thing made since I knew that it was going to be a repeated aspect in all web pages, so I took my time deicing the colours and the hover animations. Perhaps too much time since I tested out a lot of hover changes to see which ones I wanted to maintain throughout the website too. The university’s logo animation was made to be a little silly too, since I didn’t want it to be too distracting while all of the other elements were loading in.

- The footer has remained unchanged since the very beginning. It didn’t need to be anything eye-catching, so the simple design in mind was perfect.

- The animations were hard to learn, but I think that the rippling effect for the elements of the webpage was accomplished well enough to give that sensation to the viewer when they load in the website. However, I had to sacrifice some boxes having animations due to visibility issues, such as the contact.html given the hovering animation was erased when I introduced the ripple animation.

- I thought personalising the selection element would just be a fun detail that was made between the creation of the topic section, although I’m afraid there were certain areas where it just did not translate accordingly, even if sparse.

- The fav.icon was purely included because of design choices and because it wasn't complicated to introduce.

- There is an overall monochromatic color-scheme to tie in all the web pages better.

- Index.html:
- Its contents very briefly go over what one will expect to find on this website.
- This was one of the last ones I developed since I wanted to have the rest of the web pages completed to know what I should write about them in the main. I went for simplicity to not overwhelm the viewer, although perhaps it may have had the opposite effect with too much empty space around it.

- About.html:
- Its content includes a more impersonal little description of me and my hobbies, a pseudo CV section, links to my university’s social media and website, and two images of me.
- By far the webpage that gave me the most trouble. The idea was to design it similar to several popular templates for cvs, because I thought the criss-cross arrangement of the boxes would be more interesting than just repeating boxes. I particularly like the simplicity of the social media links’ icons and the circular picture at the top that required me to learn a whole new attribute with CSS. The placement of the divs was quite tricky to figure out, especially since it was one of the first websites I decided to code and my knowledge on HTML and CSS was not consolidated yet in my mind. Perhaps my CV could have been more polished too. Overall though, it is possibly the website I ended up liking the most. I believe that in the end, all the challenges I set up for myself ended up enhancing its design.

- Degree.html (and it’s subsequent websites):
- Its contents are a brief explanation of all the subjects within my five year program, an introduction to the page so it’s easier to ease-in the viewer, and the FCE’s contents.
- This webpage was the longest I worked in given it had 6 different web pages within it.

- The degree.html (referred to as main) was quite simple to design since it was just a brief introduction to what the webpage contained. I decided to add the dropdown menu because I wanted to put my skills to the test and also because I thought two navigation bars might be too tedious or an eye-sore to the viewer. It was created after the navigation menu, so incorporating it into the existing website was a little complicated. I had several formatting issues but I still enjoy the look of it (particularly that I managed for the different years to change their color when you hovered over them, since that gave me the most trouble during development as for some reason the dropdown menu kept disappearing).

- The idea for the design of the “year” web pages was to have different boxes detailing the information of the subject. I included the teachers and the credits to give the viewer some more information about the webpage too. The descriptions of each subject are thorough, but perhaps too much as I realised too late I could’ve used my time more effectively and written their respective categories rather than summarising from the university’s public study plan. Because I knew the design for all of the “year” web pages was going to be replicated, I didn’t try anything too challenging as in the about.html, and while I’m not displeased with the final result, it is perhaps the most monotonous and repetitive out of all the websites.

- AAAAAAAAAAAAAFCE.html:
- Its contets are the objectives, contents and conlusions of the subject
- I wanted its design to stand out enough from all the other web pages within the deg-sub folder, but not too much to look completely out of place in that folder.
- It turned much simpler than I expected but overall I am not too displeased with its design.

- Topic:
- Its contents are the modified version of my practical I, which was the ethics of generative AI in the video game industry.

- I wanted to style it similar to the format of an article, so instead of grouping all the different div categories similar to the about section, I went for a cascading-down layout. The content itself is from the practical I, but I did make some changes keeping in mind the comments left regarding my part and the whole of the project a few weeks ago. The image for the demographic’s graph had to be edited to fit better within the given space and to avoid it overlapping, but the key information still remains.

- Net.html:
- Its contents included 9 of my classmates’ websites, with their respective images and names attached to links to access them.
- The net.html was designed to simulate a (beginner’s)  image gallery, hence why I took screenshots of the index.html web pages of the classmates I linked in my net section. I had trouble adjusting the portions of the names to be centered and not cause their respective containers to break the illusion that the image itself is the container, especially with the longer names, but it was handled accordingly. I believe here the ripple effect is seen more clearly too once the page is loading, which I especially liked about it.

- Contact.html:
-Its contents are the form so that the viewer can input their name, email, message, phone number and a png file. There is also a brief message explaining this.
- The design was meant to be very simple too, as a nice way to close the website and to parallel the index.html’s square box layout, but it looked especially empty. Hence, the extra box explaining what could be sent too. I added the extra option of a file and phone number since, during research of what was common on contact forms, I saw a lot of inclusions of phone-numbers and file attachments. Despite liking how the glow animation behaves, it did impede me from adding the usual “loading” animations that all other elements of the website have, because when I did add them the boxes would disappear once hovered over, which was not ideal.

# General conclusions of the project:

- Very quickly, I realised that my knowledge and skills in CSS and HTML were lacking, given this has been my very first contact with them. I studied the class presentations carefully and watched several tutorials to fill my gaps in knowledge before starting.

- I also got a little frustrated with the more divs I needed to use in the web pages, as their placing within the space given often overlapped or didn't turn out how I envisioned it. Particularly the about.html section gave me the most trouble. Still, I persisted and I believe that overall my understanding of boxes, margins and paddings was greatly enriched by the end of the project.

- It’s made apparent in my developing comments, but somewhere along the project I accidentally replicated the repo’s file and when I went to update the changes it wouldn’t allow me too because I wasn’t accessing the correct files. It took me an, admittedly, panicked moment before I corrected it and continue working.

- My organisation during the project would have certainly been improved, since by the last days I created folders and moved things around to organise all elements better, but this could’ve been avoided with a more concrete plan in mind.

- I do worry that, despite being happy with the overall designs of the different web pages, the fact that the cohesion of the website was sacrificed in favour of different designs might be hard on a viewer’s eyes. In the future, I will keep in mind all of this to improve on my developing skills.

- Overall, I found this project very rewarding given how, by the end, I feel much more confident in my HTML and CSS skills and, more importantly, my knowledge on them. I do enjoy how the website looks despite its complications along the way, and I hope the effort I put into it can be seen and felt.

- Implemented a dropwon menu for them that is only triggered when you find yourself in the degree section.
- Fiished the design of what the degree pages will look like.
- Finished the content for the first year web page.
- The degree section is almost completed.
- changed all css files so that the header and the footer would be within the newly created global_style.css and made the according changes so it reflects on the different webpages.
- reorganised a lot of files to make everything more organised.
- finished everything except the fce page, of which I need to tyle to fit the already written out content I have for it.
